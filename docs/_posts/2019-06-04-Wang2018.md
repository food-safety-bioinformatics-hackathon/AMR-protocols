## Database
This protocol uses Abricate v0.7 for detection of AMR genes in E. coli. 


## Protocol

* Step 1

Sequences were queried against the ResFinder database (2,228 sequences) and the CARD database (2,153 sequences) using ABRicate. 
The following parameters were used: % coverage ≥60, % identity ≥80
The RGI tool v4.0.3 by Jia et al., 2017 was used to confirm gene presence/absence, under “perfect” and “strict” match conditions.


* Step 2

De novo assembly was performed using the Shovill pipeline (v0.8.0).
