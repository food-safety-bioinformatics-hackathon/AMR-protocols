Detecting AMR in Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes

## Summary

|Key|Value|
|----|----|
|category|read-based|

## Database
ARG-ANNOT and CARD databases

## Protocol

* Step 1

The sample consisted of 301 genomes. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for this sample were obtained from a previous analysis

* Step 2

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)-associated genes and SNPs were identified with ARIBA using ARG-ANNOT and CARD databases
