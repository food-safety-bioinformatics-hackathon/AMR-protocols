* WGS and AMR gene detection from resistant Listeria monocytogenes strains



## Summary table

|Key|Value|
|----|----|
|category|assembly-based|
|platform|illumina|
|open source|true|
|reproducible|true|


## Database

ResFinder v2.1,ARG-ANNOT v4 and CARD v2.0.3 databases in ABRicate


## Protocol


* Step 1

Genomic DNA was sequenced using the HiSeq (Illumina)

* Step 2

SOAP de novo v2.04, and SPAdes were used for de novo assembly 

* Step 3 

Antimicrobial resistance genes were searched through the database using thresholds of ≥ 90.0% for both nucleotide identity and sequence coverage.
