## Database
This protocol uses Abricate v0.5-dev3 for detection of AMR genes in S. aureus (in burn patients across sub-Saharan Africa). Command for installation of Abricate and its dependencies is available via github (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate).


## Protocol

* Step 1
Genomic DNA was extracted using the Ultraclean microbial DNA isolation kit


* Step 2
DNA libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT v2 kit and sequenced on the Illumina platform using 2 × 250-bp chemistry

*Step 3
The raw reads were assembled into contigs using spades 3.9.0 and mapped to the fully assembled chromosome of S. aureus COL (ST250) (chromosome: CP000046) using snippy v3.21

*Step 4
Antibiotic resistance detection were undertaken with abricate v0.5-dev3.
