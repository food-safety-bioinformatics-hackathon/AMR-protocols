## Database

ResFinder database 


## Protocol


* Step 1

Genomic DNA was sequenced using the Illumina platform

* Step 2

Sanger Institute assembly and improvement pipeline (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5320598/) was used for de novo genome assembly 


* Step 3 

Antimicrobial resistance genes were searched through the database
